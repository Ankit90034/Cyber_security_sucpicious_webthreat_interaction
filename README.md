# Cyber_security_sucpicious_webthreat_interaction

### About Dataset
  This dataset contains web traffic records collected through AWS CloudWatch, aimed
  at detecting suspicious activities and potential attack attempts.
  The data were generated by monitoring traffic to a production web server, using
  various detection rules to identify anomalous patterns.

### Dataset Content
Each entry in the dataset represents a stream of traffic to a web server, including the
following columns:
- bytes_in: Bytes received by the server.
- bytes_out: Bytes sent from the server.
- creation_time: Timestamp of when the record was created.
- end_time: Timestamp of when the connection ended.
- src_ip: Source IP address.
- src_ip_country_code: Country code of the source IP.
- protocol: Protocol used in the connection.
- response.code: HTTP response code.
- dst_port: Destination port on the server.
- dst_ip: Destination IP address.
- rule_names: Name of the rule that identified the traffic as suspicious.
- observation_name: Observations associated with the traffic.
- source.meta: Metadata related to the source.
- source.name: Name of the traffic source.
- time: Timestamp of the detected event.
- detection_types: Type of detection applied.

### Project Overview
Objective: To detect and analyze patterns in web interactions for identifying
suspicious or potentially harmful activities.

### Steps:
#### 1. Data Import and Basic Overview:
During this step I have to import the data into jupyter notebook and perform basic overview of data such as using methods like *df.head()*, *df.describe()*,*df.info()* etc.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
Here missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies are handled carefully.For this first I have to identify the missing values using *df.isnull().sum()* and then null values are filled with mediun of column if column is numeric and with mode if column is of categorical type.

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze Traffic Patterns Based on bytes_in and bytes_out

#### 4. Feature Engineering
Extract useful features, like duration and average packet size, to aid in analysis.

#### 5. Data Visualization
- Country-based Interaction Analysis
- Suspicious Activities Based on Ports

#### 6. Modeling: Anomaly Detection
This step uses Isolation Forest, a common technique for detecting anomalies.

#### 7. Evaluation
Evaluate the anomaly detection model by checking its accuracy in identifying
suspicious activities.

#### 8. Visualization of Anomalies
Here anomalies are visualized using code snippet:
*plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='bytes_in', y='bytes_out', hue='anomaly',
data=df, palette=['green', 'red'])
plt.title('Anomalies in Bytes In vs Bytes Out')
plt.show()*

#### 9. Report Findings
Based on the model output and visualizations, interpret the most frequent anomaly
patterns, source IPs, and ports related to suspicious activities.
##### Insights:
- High bytes_in and low bytes_out sessions could indicate possible infiltration
  attempts.
- Frequent interactions from specific country codes may indicate targeted or
  bot-related attacks.
- High activity on non-standard ports may signal unauthorized access
  attempts.
